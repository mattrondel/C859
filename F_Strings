Here's a basic explanation of how f-strings work:

Syntax: An f-string is created by prefixing a string literal with the letter 'f' or 'F'. Inside the string, you can include expressions enclosed in curly braces {}.

code:
name = "Alice"
age = 30
print(f"My name is {name} and I am {age} years old.")

Expression Evaluation: The expressions inside the curly braces are evaluated at runtime and their values are inserted into the string.

Variables and Expressions: You can include variables, literals, and even more complex expressions inside the curly braces.

code:
x = 5
y = 10
print(f"The sum of {x} and {y} is {x + y}.")


Formatting Options: You can also specify formatting options within the curly braces to control how the values are displayed. For example, you can control the number of decimal places for a floating-point number.

code:
pi = 3.14159
print(f"The value of pi is approximately {pi:.2f}.")

In this example, :.2f specifies that the floating-point number should be formatted with two decimal places.

F-strings were introduced in Python 3.6, and they provide a concise and readable way to create formatted strings compared to older methods like using the % formatting or str.format() methods. They are widely used in modern Python code for their simplicity and readability.
