Do PA, make mistakes, write them down




#######################
10/17 First try of the day


mistakes made
#1 

Forgot 2 decimal places in print statement
pasted variable and added a word with a space

2#
This is the ounces/minutes build a function one
f strings are f" think of the " as the word strings
need to memorize questions 2s formatting/pattern

#3
this is the index and type()
this is a three part one, need to remember how to build it out


#4
trapzoid/triangle
I can solve the PA no problem the one Derek mentioned I need to work one

#5
this is the combining numbers one
forgot to close ()
the float needs to be simple not complex float(solution_to_sum)

#6
this is a three part
need to refresh on slicing
I actually was able to recall this from memory

7#
forgot to build my f strint print statement correctly
was able to recall most of this

8#
this is try and except
try and except lines always stop with colons like so:
try:
except:
when using except lines with items add them with () then adding the colon to let python know this ends what you want it to do
On this I need to compare with Dereks differences
the PA is very simple the tough part is taking what its asking and turing it into code

9#
this is the damn branching temperature/grades one going to need to practice this over and over
didnt solve

10#
THIS IS A THREE PART PROBLEM
need to work on Dereks vairant
didnt solve

11-14 skipped and left blank

#11 looked at but this needs to be practiced
there is a lot of steps in this one and i wonder if it can be simplified currently 7 lines of code
was tempted to paste and commented out random lines to see what score would be if 11-13 are purposed done wrong or not at all

need to work on 14 with Coles help

#15 
pasted pigage then hit submit to move to the other building
stopped here 

RESULTS:
skipping / purposly not solving 11, 12, 13 and getting #4 wrong the score was "Competent" but the green was right on the bar (passed by a hair!!)
