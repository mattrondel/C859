# Notes from practicing 

how would this look if we took a string input instead and return the index value
keep the try and except intact

int as input

frameworks = ["Django", "Flask", "CherryPy", "Bottle", "Web2Py", "TurboGears"]

try:
    search_string = int(input())
    index = frameworks.index(search_string)
    print(index)
except ValueError:
    print("Error")
try:
    search_string = int(input())
    index = frameworks.index(search_string)
    print(index)
except ValueError:
    print("Error")
	
# ====
# how this would look if we took a string input instead and return the index value

frameworks = ["Django", "Flask", "CherryPy", "Bottle", "Web2Py", "TurboGears"]

try:
    search_string = input()
    index = frameworks.index(search_string)
    print(index)
except ValueError:
    print("Error")

The main changes are:

1. Removed the int() conversion since we want to keep it as a string
2. The rest of the code stays the same since .index() works with both strings and integers

The code will still catch the ValueError if the string isn't found in the frameworks list, and print "Error" in that case.
