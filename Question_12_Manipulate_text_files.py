# Help me solve and understand this python problem and also solve it so it can accept any input, remove any error checking, do this without a try and except and not with a function and have it condensed and simplifed and break this down step by step so I can understand this

# Create a solution that opens a file and combines the words on each line into a sentence. Write the sentence string to the end of the text file "WordTextFile1.txt" on a new line. 
# Output the new contents of "WordTextFile1.txt". Use the open() function and write(), read() methods to interact with the text file.

# The solution output should be in the format:

# WordTextFile1.txt_contents
# word1
# word2
# word3 
# sentence
#  
# Sample Input/Output:
# If the file content is:

# WordTextFile1.txt

# then the expected output is
# cat
# chases
# dog
# cat chases dog
