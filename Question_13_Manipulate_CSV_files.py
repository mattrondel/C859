# Help me solve and understand this python problem and also solve it so it can accept any input, remove any error checking, do this without a try and except and not with a funtion and have it condensed and simplifed

# Create a solution that accepts an input identifying the name of a CSV file, for example, "input1.csv". Each file contains two rows of comma-separated values. Import the built-in module csv and use its open() function and reader() method to create a dictionary of key:value pairs for each row of comma-separated values in the specified file. Output the file contents as two dictionaries.
# The solution output should be in the format
# {key:value,key:value,key:value}
# {key:value,key:value,key:value}
#  
# Sample Input/Output:
# If the file content is
# input1.csv
# then the expected output is
# {a:100,b:200,c:300}
# {bananas:1.85,steak:19.99,cookies:4.52}
# Alternatively, if the file content is
# input2.csv
# then the expected output is
# {d:400,e:500,f:600}
# {celery:2.81,milk:4.34,bread:5.63}

# sample file:
# input1.csv
# contents:
#  a, 100, b, 200, c, 300
# bananas, 1.85, steak, 19.99, cookies, 4.52
