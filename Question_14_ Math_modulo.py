# Create a solution that accepts an integer input. Import the built-in module math and use its factorial() method to calculate the factorial of the integer input. Output the value of the factorial, as well as a Boolean value identifying whether the factorial output is greater than 100.
# The solution output should be in the format
# factorial_value
# Boolean_value
#  
# Sample Input/Output:
# If the input is
# 10
# then the expected output is
# 3628800
# True
# Alternatively, if the input is
# 3
# then the expected output is
# 6
# False
