# Instructions:
# Create a Python solution to the following task. Ensure that the solution produces output in exactly the same format shown in the sample(s) below, including capitalization and whitespace.
#  
# Task:
# Create a solution that accepts an integer input representing the index value for any any of the five elements in the following list:
# various_data_types = [516, 112.49, True, "meow", ("Western", "Governors", "University"), {"apple": 1, "pear": 5}]
# Using the built-in function type() and getting its name by using the .name attribute, output data type (e.g., int”, “float”, “bool”, “str”) based on the input index value of the list element.
# The solution output should be in the format
# Element index_value: data_type
#  
# Sample Input/Output:
# If the input is
# 4
# then the expected output is
# Element 4: tuple
