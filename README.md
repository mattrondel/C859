Post exam notes:
dictaries how to get the ID of an item in a dictionary like you input a name of somthing in a dictonary or list how can you get the ID back
in dicts how 

candy machine
int input first then how to request that many after the fact


if else statements
what order do they go in smallest largest etc, think of the grade question

ranges like 80 to 85 on test 


perfect square in math.sqrt


53% 1-8

20% 9-11

27% 12-15

   12 might end up skipping

   13 might end up skipping



3/15 PA only attempted 1-6 and 15 -this was not enough to pass

need to master 8, its simple enough

9 seems complicated

review 10 its similar to 3

11 is also similar to 3

12 will make you hate life with the text import statenents

13 is like 12 only with csv hate blended in

14 might be doable with practice - the math module

all of the above practice with the similar wgu zybook page test it and then put lessions learned in each page
