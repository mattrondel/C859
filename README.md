7.14 Arbitrary argument lists

Arbitrary arguments

Sometimes a programmer doesn't know how many arguments a function requires. A function definition can include a *args parameter that collects optional positional parameters into an arbitrary argument list tuple

Post exam notes:

Areas I sucked in:
try/except
loops I didnt use any anywhere I didn where to use them

QUOTED STUFF FROM HERE: https://github.com/mattrondel/C859/edit/main/CI_Advice_after_1srt

 being able to open files and read from and write to them  NEED TO CHECK THIS "is covered pretty well in Ch 14 and 31 and their Labs."
 
"Remember, it’s a good idea to use the str strip() method on input() calls almost by default. Watch lines inside of file content and strip those line returns if 

needed as well. Take a look at zyDE 10.3.2 for a perfect example of how (and why) to do this."

"D335/C859 v4 Exam Review recording. (2 hours, 25 min)"

dictaries how to get the ID of an item in a dictionary like you input a name of somthing in a dictonary or list how can you get the ID back
in dicts how 

candy machine
int input first then how to request that many after the fact


if else statements
what order do they go in smallest largest etc, think of the grade question

ranges like 80 to 85 on test 


perfect square in math.sqrt


53% 1-8

20% 9-11

27% 12-15

   12 might end up skipping

   13 might end up skipping



3/15 PA only attempted 1-6 and 15 -this was not enough to pass

need to master 8, its simple enough

9 seems complicated

review 10 its similar to 3

11 is also similar to 3

12 will make you hate life with the text import statenents

13 is like 12 only with csv hate blended in

14 might be doable with practice - the math module

all of the above practice with the similar wgu zybook page test it and then put lessions learned in each page
