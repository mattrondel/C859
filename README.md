53% 1-8

20% 9-11

27% 12-15
   12 might end up skipping
   13 might end up skipping

3/15 PA only attempted 1-6 and 15

need to master 8, its simple enough

9 seems complicated

review 10 its similar to 3

11 is also similar to 3

12 will make you hate life with the text import statenents

13 is like 12 only with csv hate blended in

14 might be doable with practice

all of the above practice with the similar wgu zybook page test it and then put lessions learned in each page
