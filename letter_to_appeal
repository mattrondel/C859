I am requesting a Scholarship Appeal Request
I am on my final course to complete my degree 

I have been working weekly basis and course instructors and have sceduled several peer tutor sessions with the proramming center
This is my final course to complete my degree. 

I am also is working with the Assessment Services Office to review the results of the assessment.
I am on my 3rd attempt with the objective assesment

The reason I didn't make OJ is because this is my final course to graduate, and I did not pass
"OTP, and you believe that should be taken into consideration, you may submit a Scholarship Appeal Request. "




The reason I did not meet my On Time Progress (OTP) is due my last term only containing my last remaining course in my degree plan. This was my second attempt at passing the objective assessment and I did not pass.  During this term I met on a weekly basis with my mentor, course instructors, and peer tutor sessions with the programming center.  I am currently working with the Assessment Services Office to review the results of the assessment. Pending this outcome I may need to register for this course again.
I want to assure that this setback is not indicative of my overall academic performance or dedication to my studies. Throughout my academic journey, I have consistently demonstrated my commitment to excellence and have actively sought support when faced with challenges. The fact that I engaged regularly with my mentor, course instructors, and utilized peer tutoring services underscores my proactive approach to overcoming obstacles.
I am fully committed to completing my degree and am taking all necessary steps to address this situation. Whether the outcome of the assessment review requires me to retake the course or provides an alternative solution, I am prepared to put in the extra effort required to succeed. I kindly request the committee's understanding and support during this temporary setback. Your continued faith in my academic potential would be greatly appreciated as I work diligently to get back on track and successfully complete my degree program.
I have also copied my program Mentor Don Cook on this email.
Thank you,
